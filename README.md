# Vex-Robotics

This is a mono-repo containing a collection of code, cad, photos, and design notebooks for each year of Vex-Robotics I have competed in as a part of 1104X/1104D. Each season is in its own folder labeled with its season year and name and has its own readme giving a quick recap of the season.

***Note** doc folders can be ignored as they are only used to store assets needed for readmes.*
